## Installation

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
3. You need to set up the backend services to make the application fully functional. I use AWS API Gateway to create the REST API, but you can use any backend service of your choice. (You'll find the Coffee interface in `src/interfaces/Coffee.tsx`)
